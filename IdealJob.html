<p>This position at Kojima appeals to me, because within this industry Australia is not where you typically see AAA games being produced.</p>
<p>but the industry is growing.</p>
<p>So by having atleast been with a company that is well known in the industry would also be an appealing resume, if the industry gets to that point in Australia.</p>
<p>The country also appealing to stay at</p>
<p>The skills I currently have is a bit of C#</p>
<p>My plan for achieving the other qualification:</p>
<p>The first thing is to be fluent in Japanese, which I aim to obtain that by doing an exchange program at Japan</p>
<p>Next is to learn C++ which would be done next year for my IT elective for Advanced Programming Techniques & Interactive 3D Graphics and Animation</p> 
<p>The other one is to learn AI which is also done for one of my IT electives for Artificial Intelligence</p>
